As I watched [Apple's Keynote](http://www.apple.com/live/2014-sept-event/) yesterday, there were quite a few new things to be noticed. On of the major headlines included Apple's transition to yet another [new, thinner iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/). Apple's new iPhone 6s are incredibly thin, at just 6.9 and 7.1 mm. They're filled with all of the software and hardware goodies we've come to expect from such a release. They're also, unsurprisingly, "the biggest advancement to the iPhone since the original iPhone". Although most of the physical features of the new iPhones had already been leaked and confirmed, one part of Apple's design of the new phones really stuck out to me.

Apple traditionally designs it's products with extremely smooth edges. In both new iPhone 6 models, the camera actually protrudes from the phone in a noticable departure from normal design. Having afforded this exception, that means that the thickest single factor in a new iPhone is now the headphone jack.

Aside from the camera (and any limits in current technology), the headphone jack is the single thing from stopping Apple from making their devices even thinner. What does this mean? The headphone jack's days are numbered. At least on Apple's devices. (Though heaphone jacks on the iPad and Macbook still have a little time left.)

In June, Apple [announced](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/06/05/apple-announces-lightning-enabled-headphone-standard-in-wwdc-session) support for Lightning-enabled headphones, meaning that compatible headphones could plug directly into the lightning connector rather than the standard audio jack. Today, Philips was [the first company](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/10/philips-announces-fidelo-m2l-the-first-ever-apple-lightning-headphones-with-24-bit-dac-audio) to take advantage by introducing a pair of Lightning-compatible headphones.

It's no conincidence Apple chose to [kill the iPod classic](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/09/apple-finally-kills-off-ipod-classic-after-13-years-of-service) yesterday. With no mention, a swift update to the Apple Store online took the iPod off the market, and with it, the last 30-pin connector capable device. Although Apple said nothing about removing the product, it cements Apple's stance that the Lightning Cable is here to stay.

The Lightning connector is the future. Although many bemoaned the transition from the beloved 30-pin connector, it was time for a change. Apple designs it's cables and connectors with an incredible degree of foresight, and the Lightning connector is no exception. Athough right now it only charges phones and plays audio, the connector will undoubtedly grow to serve other purposes.

I expect Apple to introduce new APIs in the future so that developers can send data and other signals through the connector to any App Store app. Soon, every device that needs a physical connection to an iPhone will use Apple's patented connector. Once headphone makers and other device manufacturers get on board, the headphone jack will be history.

It's really a bit sad. Eschewing the last analog port on the iPhone means that interfacing with certain analog devices will now be impossible without an analog to digital converter. The headphone industry will have to offer multiple models of its products just to support multiple adapters, as there's no way for Android companies to license Lightning.

And yet, we will adapt. Apple has pressure from consumers to constantly innovate by making devices bigger, yet at the same time thinner and lighter. This pressure to "innovate" has lead Apple to push the boundary by removing the CD drive and Ethernet jack from every laptop it currently sells. And although it can be somewhat inconvenient initally, these innovations become less and less of a problem as time goes on. The Lightning connector will become the mainstream connector for headphones just a bit too early for the general public, who will complain because their favorite headphone model doesn't come in the Lightning variant. But over time, comapnies and consumers will adapt. The iPhone will get thin. And life will go on.
