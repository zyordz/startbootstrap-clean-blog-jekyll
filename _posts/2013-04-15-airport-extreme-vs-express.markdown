On June 11th, 2012, Apple gave the Airport Express a complete overhaul. With new features such as simultaneous dual-band transmission, guest networking, wireless printer sharing, and ethernet port, and support for up to 50 users, the Express has in the last few updates started to come into close feature partiy with the Extreme. And, priced at only $99, it does almost everything that its $179 counterpart can do. So, what’s the difference? And in what cases is buying the more expensive model justified?

For the longest time, the Airport Express was meant more as an accessory than a full-time router. It would easily extend the range of your Airport Extreme, wirelessly stream music to an audio out via AirPlay, and set up an ad hoc network in a hotel room. But the advantages of the Extreme were always clear: dual-band networking, wireless printer sharing, and support of more than 10 users were features available only on the more expensive model. Now, the differences are not quite so cut and dry.

Let me start with the obvious differences: The Extreme features a Gigabit WAN port and 3 Gigabit LAN ports, while the Express only features one of each, and the ports only work up to 100 Mbps. For most residential customers, this is not an issue: their download speed is not faster than 100 Mbps. If you’re a power user that needs more than one LAN port, however, an Extreme makes more sense. The Express has a USB port that can be used to share printers wirelessly, while the Extreme can use its USB port not only to share printers, but also to share external hard drives over the network. While a USB hub can be plugged into an Extreme to share multiple hard drives and printers, it seems the Express can only share a single printer.

There are other differences that are a little harder to dig up. The Extreme is a 3 stream router, while the Express is only 2 stream. In theory, this manefests itself as a difference between the throughputs of the routers. While the Extreme can push out 450 Mbps in 5 GHz and 225 Mbps in 2.4 GHz, the Express is only capable of 300 and 150 Mbps, respectively. In practice, though, this difference might only change the speed of your throughput by 10 to 30%. This 3rd stream really helps to fill out your whole home with wifi, even in places that the Express might have trouble broadcasting. The Extreme is also capapble of using its radio to output a slightly higher power level, which similarly helps fill out larger homes or offices.

The one advantage that the Express has over the Extreme is a feature that’s been standard on the Express since its inception: an audio output that can be used to stream music wirelessly through the home. On the new Express, it’s a dual-function audio port, meaning it supports both analog and digital optical (Toslink) audio.

If you have a set of speakers you’d like to stream music wirelessly to, the Express makes itself a natural choice. If you’re a power user that needs more ethernet or USB ports, the Extreme makes more sense. You should also get an Extreme if you’re in a bigger house or office that an Express might have a hard time saturating with signal. If you’re a lucky (and/or rich) user who has more than 100 Mbps internet to play with, an Extreme might give you a slightly faster connection. But if you’re just an average user, looking for hassle-free setup in a fairly inexpensive but robust product, the Airport Express is the right router for you.
