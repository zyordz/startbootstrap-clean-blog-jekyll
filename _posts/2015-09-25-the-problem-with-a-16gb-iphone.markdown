Apple recently [announced](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/09/09Apple-Introduces-iPhone-6s-iPhone-6s-Plus.html) and shipped its newest set of iPhones, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. They've done a solid job this S-cycle, as they have done in previous S-cycles, creating a phone that's not only iterative but also has some awesome new gotta-have features.

This year's series of phones add a ton of hardware and software onto the powerhouse that already is the iPhone: 3D Touch, Live Photos, 4K video, Touch ID 2.0... I woke up at 3 AM to pre-order one.

Over the past few years, Apple has made solid strides with their phones - well far and above what I'd even attribute to the "forward march of progress". Just have a look at these graphs:

Apple has iterated so mechanically and so steadily on almost every aspect of the iPhone over the years that it goes beyond impressive. The original iPhone shipped with a 412 MHz CPU with 128 MB of RAM, a 2.0 MP camera, 1400 mAH battery, and a 320x480 pixel 3.5 inch screen at 163 ppi. This year's iPhone 6S Plus completely destroys these original specs - a 1.4 GHz dual-core 64-bit CPU with 2 GB of RAM; a 12 MP rear camera that includes facial recognition, digital image stablization, and shoots 4K (!) video; a 2915 mAH battery; and a 1920x1080 pixel 5.5 inch screen at 401 ppi. None of this would have been possible if Apple hadn't iterated on their phones each and every year.

But there is one spec that hasn't changed in over 6 years - since the *2009* introduction of the **iPhone 3GS**, in fact. Every phone since 2009 has shipped with 16 GB of storage at the bottom tier.

This is a problem.

It's now [common knowledge](http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-please-kill-the-16gb-iphone/) that a [16GB iPhone](http://bgr.com/2015/09/17/apple-iphone-6s-16gb-vs-64gb/) is [practically uesless](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9311203/apple-16gb-iphone6s). People have [done the math](http://bgr.com/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-4k-video-16-gb/). A new 16GB iPhone will only be able to capture about 35 minutes of 4K video, and that's not counting the space that would be taken up by other Apps, Podcasts, and Music. The new Live Photos feature takes up about double the space as a normal picture. And you can bet space is going to fill up fast with that swanky new 12MP camera. Mainstream publications are already [publishing guides](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/16gb-iphone-6s-storage-tips/) on what you can do to make the most of your precious 16 gigabytes.

In the past, there's been conversation about Apple's technical ability to ship 32GB in an iPhone chipset. People have argued that it's not feasible for Apple to add a 32GB chipset at such volume. I don't buy it. Apple's iPhone volume has enabled them to do things in the past that no other phone maker had ever done. And with this most recent wave of Apple products, it's pretty clear that 32GB is the new standard. Apple's new Apple TV and iPad Pro both start at 32GB of storage. To me, this indicates that a 32GB chipset exists, and could easily be incorporated into the latest generation of iPhones.

There's also been conversation about how a 32GB iPhone might affect Apple's Average Selling Price. By most estimates, it costs about $8 for the 16GB storage in an iPhone, while it costs $16 for the 32GB chipset. It really wouldn't hurt the Apple all that much from a parts perspective to include 32 gigabytes at the bottom level, but it would definitely hurt their ASP.

The problem comes with the common knowledge that the 16GB iPhone is no good. At the current moment, there are a lot of users that spring for the $100 upgrade to a 64GB phone. If Apple decided to include 32GB at the bottom tier, there might be a large subset of those people that decide that a 32GB iPhone would be good enough for them. In fact, I fall into this category.

It's a dumb move. Apple's already sitting on a veritable mountain of cash - a mountain that's so big that they don't really even know what to do with it. And cheaping out on the storage is probably a move that hurts Apple in the long run, which is not measured with ASP but a much more intangible user satisfaction.

And yet, even if Apple's true motivations for this decision are financial, it doesn't bother me. The iPhone is a premuim phone, and one that I know I'm paying extra for. I don't mind an extra $100 for a product that I know I'll use each and every day. I don't mind a little more for a phone that has a better user interface and better functionality.

The thing that really bothers me is the lack of innovation. For years, Apple has been known as a company that has pushed the envelope on innovation. They've historically been known to systematically abandon widely-used technologies in favor of the future of technology. People were up in arms when Apple abandoned the floppy-drive for the much more uncommon CD drive. Similarly, people complained when that same CD drive was jettisoned completely. But Apple was forward-looking. They used their "reckless" abandon of old technologies to usher consumers into an era of new technology dominance.

Apple has never been afraid to innvoate, to push the bar, to provide premium features and an excellent user experience to boot. Apple makes premium products with guts that are "as obessively engineered" as the beautiful shell that they come in.

But in this instance, I'm dissapointed with the internal storage. Apple hasn't innovated with storage on the iPhone. Instead, they've stayed at the same base-level storage for the last 6 years. They've fallen behind their competition. The only "innovation" seen in this space is in features like App Thining, which only allow them to continue to fall further behind. This isn't obsessive engineering. It's laziness. It's complacency.

The new iPhone 6S only offers 4 times the storage of the original iPhone on the lower end of the storage tier. The 128GB high-tier storage offers 16 times the maximum storage on the original iPhone when it was released. I don't know what Apple's reasons are for such a decision, but I do feel the impact that it has on me as a customer.

Perhaps Apple has gotten complacent because they're the 800-lb gorilla in the smartphone room. Or maybe it's because they know that they'll still make a boatload  of money on a product even if it isn't perfect. But this isn't the Apple that I know or the Apple that I fell in love with. I think Apple still has that lineage, that history of the nimble company that they once were. But I'm afraid that Apple has changed for the worse. I'm afraid that Apple is making decisions based more on what benefits the general public and the company than what benefits Apple enthusiasts, than what benefits me.

And that's a sad realization. Even though I wasn't old enough to be a part of Apple's earliest history, I grew up using Apple computers and definitely was a huge fan well before their second rise to power, and well before the iPhone was even an idea in Steve Jobs' head. (Well, [maybe not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform)).) While it has seemed for some time that every decision seemed to be in my best interest, it no longer seems that way with each and every minute detail of the computers Apple makes.

Don't get me wrong, Apple is still the chip-leader and best in town when it comes to making phones and computers. And I'm going to continue to buy Apple products well into the forseeable future. Even if they're not perfect, they remain years ahead of the competition. But as far as storage is concerned, I can only hope next year's iPhone 7 ships with something reasonable.
